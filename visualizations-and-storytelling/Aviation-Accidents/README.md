# Aviation Accidents Reporting
The Power BI file and infographic were created from the intention of an airline promoting flight safety. Based on a pretend scenario, the public was questioning how safe it was to fly commercial. The dashboard was created for internal use to track safety, and the infographic was created to inform the public of the facts.
