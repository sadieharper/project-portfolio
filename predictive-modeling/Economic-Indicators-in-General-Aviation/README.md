# Economic Indicators in General Aviation
The general aviation industry often fluctuates from year to year. In good years, manufacturers are selling a lot of aircraft but bad years can lead to a number of problems within a business. I wanted to dive into shipment data for general aviation aircraft to see if there are any economic trends that might be a leading indicator for where this industry is headed next.
