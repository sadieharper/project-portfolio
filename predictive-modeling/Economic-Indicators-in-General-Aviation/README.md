# Economic Indicators in General Aviation
Maintenance failures occur within many different industries and happen to all different types of products. This can extend from aircraft, automobiles, machinery, and more. Being able to predict when a failure is likely to occur can benefit any company greatly. This project takes synthetic maintenance data to build a machine learning model that can predict when a failure is most likely to happen and why.
